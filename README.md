### Hello world, I'm Javi 👋
------------------------------------------------------------

I am 🦠**biotechnologist**🔬 with a Master's degree in 🏞️🍁**Environmental Agrobiology**🍂🌲 who decided to jump into the 💻**coding world**💻. Currently, I'm a student at **[4️2 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com/en/)** where I'm learning to code without teachers, everything we do is *peer2peer*. If you want to learn more about the 42 method, you can check the webpage linked before!

Here I will upload the different projects I complete during my learning process, as well as some personal ones that I could develop during that time.
